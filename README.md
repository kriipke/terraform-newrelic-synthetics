# synthetics_monitor

This Terraform module creates New Relic Synthetics monitors and alert conditions to validate `/version` endpoints for services deployed across Kubernetes clusters. Each cluster can be defined as a **private location**, and each service can be configured with specific **public and/or private locations**.
